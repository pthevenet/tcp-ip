[Q1]
We run pingall and only 2 out of the 42 connections (5%) seem to be functional.
These two connections are the ones between h1 and r1. The connections between h2 and r2 are not functional because we are pinging with IPv4 and r2 is not configured with IPv4 (otherwise it works with IPv6). Furthermore, routers don't have enough routing entries in their routing tables.

[Q2]
At r1, we can find the subnets :
IPv4 : 
10.10.11.0/24 via r1-eth3
10.10.12.0/24 via r1-eth1
10.10.14.0/24 via r1-eth2
126.0.0.0/8 via lo
IPv6 :
2001:1:0:11::/64 via r1-eth3
2001:1:0:12::/64 via r1-eth1
2001:1:0:14::/64 via r1-eth2


[Q3]
By looking at the destination  address of the OSPF packets, we can see that OSPF uses multicast to distribute routing information (sending to the multicast address 224.0.0.5).
Confirmed by this line in the log file :
2017/11/15 11:20:38 OSPF: Hello sent to [224.0.0.5] via [r1-eth2:10.10.14.1].

[Q4]
The routing table :
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF: ========== OSPF routing table ==========
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF: N 10.10.12.0/24	0.0.0.0	intra-area	10
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF:   -> 0.0.0.0
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF: N 10.10.23.0/24	0.0.0.0	intra-area	20
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF:   -> 10.10.12.2
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF: N 10.10.25.0/24	0.0.0.0	intra-area	20
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF:   -> 10.10.12.2
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF: N 10.10.35.0/24	0.0.0.0	intra-area	30
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF:   -> 10.10.12.2
2017/11/15 11:34:57 OSPF: ========================================

We can see that r1 identifies r2 (looking at the next hops) by its ip address on the same subnet as r1 : 10.10.12.2

[Q5]
    Neighbor ID Pri State           Dead Time Address         Interface            RXmtL RqstL DBsmL

We can see that r2 has 3 neighbors , with ids 10.10.14.1, 10.10.35.3 and 10.10.45.5.
The designated router is 10.10.35.3, the backup designated routers are 10.10.14.1 and 10.10.45.5 (looking at the State column).

[Q6]
The Dead Time value represents the waiting time until the router will declare the neighbor down if no hello packet is received from this neighbor.
The Dead Time has to be more than the hello timer because otherwise the neighbor will always seem down, to care about dropped hello packets, it has to be large enough (for example 4 times the hello timer in this case).
From multiple observations, it seems that the Dead Timer is set to 40s and the Hello Timer to 10 s (Dead timer updates from 30s to 40s).

[Q7]
Running the command "show ip ospf database network self-originated" we can see that 	r2 advertises 	for subnets 10.10.12.2/24 and 10.10.25.2/24.
It does not advertises for 10.10.35.3/24 because it is not the designated router for it (it is 10.10.35.3).

Using the commands on r2
show ip ospf database router adv-router 10.10.14.1
show ip ospf database router adv-router 10.10.11.1
show ip ospf database router adv-router 10.10.12.1

We see that r1 advertises prefixes 10.10.14.0/24 and 10.10.11.0/24 ( which are stub networks (r4 does not have ospf enabled)) and a transit network 10.10.12.2/24

We see the advertised router LSA from r1 :

[Q9]
Router LSAs : 4
Network LSAs : 4
Indeed r2 receives 4 router LSAs from the 4 ospf enabled routers (r1, r2, r3 and r5) because each router needs to send a router LSA to describe itself to the others in the same ospf area.
(Each ospf router floods a type 1 lsa in the area)
And r2 receives 4 network LSAs corresponding to the 4 Designated Routers in the spanning tree (10.10.12.2, 10.10.23.3, 10.10.25.2 and 10.10.35.5).
(Each ospf DR router floods a type 2 lsa)

[Q10]
h2> traceroute 10.10.35.5
traceroute to 10.10.35.5 (10.10.35.5), 64 hops max
  1   10.10.22.2  0.912ms  0.820ms  0.675ms 
  2   10.10.23.3  1.922ms  10.10.35.5  2.137ms  10.10.23.3  1.291ms 

We can see that the traceroute packets are passed from r2 to r3 and r5 (some go to r2, the others to r5).
At r2, we see two routes for 10.10.35.0/24 :
10.10.35.0/24  proto zebra  metric 20 
        nexthop via 10.10.23.3  dev r2-eth2 weight 1
        nexthop via 10.10.25.5  dev r2-eth3 weight 1

Since the cost to go from r2 to 10.10.35.0/24 is the same from r3 and r5, ospf saves both routes to perform per flow load balancing.

[Q11]
As we saw, yes.

[Q12]
When trying to ping from Jon to Dany, we get destination net unreachable.
Doing a capture on r1, we observe that r1 does sends "network unreachable" to Jon.
Looking at the routing info "ip show ospf database" on r1, we observe that there is no LSA for 10.10.12.0/24 which explains the "network unreachable".
Looking at the ospfd.conf of r1, we see that "!network 10.10.12.0/24 area 0" this line is commented, so we decomment it.
Indeed this configuration specifies that 10.10.12.0/24 is not ospf enabled, which we have to change.
After changing it (decommented it and restarted ospfd, and waiting some time), we see that ping works from Jon to Dany.

[Q13]
The spf tree :
r5> show ipv6 ospf6 spf tree 
+-10.10.45.5 [0]
   +-10.10.45.5 Net-ID: 0.0.2.33 [1]
   |  +-10.10.25.2 [1]
   |     +-10.10.25.2 Net-ID: 0.0.2.21 [2]
   |     |  +-10.10.14.1 [2]
   |     +-10.10.35.3 Net-ID: 0.0.2.25 [2]
   +-10.10.45.5 Net-ID: 0.0.2.41 [1]
      +-10.10.35.3 [1]

r5>show ipv6 ospf6 linkstate
indicates us the cost of the links, we can deduce that the cost from a router to a network is 1, the cost from a network to a router is 0.

[Q14]
No, because h1 does not run ospf, and therefore do not take care of the LSAs.
The Default Gateway was configured from the start. "ip route" on h1 does not show any updates.

[Q15]
network 10.10.35.0/24 metric : [110/30]
network 10.10.45.0/24 metric : [110/30]

[Q16]
r4 appears in the neighbor list of r1 after a few seconds.
At r1, we see the state of r4 going from Init/DROther to Full/Backup.

This line shows the change of state :
2017/11/16 20:28:22 OSPF: nsm_change_state(10.10.45.4, Loading -> Full): scheduling new router-LSA origination

The total number of states in the OSPF neighbor fsm is 8 (Down, Attempt,  Init, 2-Way, ExStart, Exchange, Loading, Full) see RFC 2328 10.1

[Q17]
There is a new router LSA :
Link ID         ADV Router      Age  Seq#       CkSum  Link count
10.10.45.4      10.10.45.4         3 0x80000003 0x56e8 2

And a new network LSA :
Link ID         ADV Router      Age  Seq#       CkSum
10.10.14.1      10.10.14.1         2 0x80000001 0x5853


In the network LSAs descriptions, we can see that 10.10.45.4 has been added as an attached router to the network 10.10.14.1/24.
Indeed, as r4 becomes ospf enabled, it is added.
Moreover 10.10.45.4 is also added to the 10.10.45.5/24 network, for the same reasons.

In the router LSAs description, we can see that the link ID 10.10.14.1 is now connected to a Transit Network (it used to be a stub network because there were no other ospf router connected to this subnet) because r4 is now the second ospf router in 10.10.14.0/24.
We also see an advertisement from r4 for 10.10.45.4/24, and that r4 is connected to two transit networks : r4 detected r1.

[Q18]
We see two ZEBRA_IPV4_ROUTE_ADD : one two 10.10.35.0/24 via 10.10.14.4 and one to 10.10.45.0/24 via 10.10.14.4 (checking the zebra daemon).
This makes sense because by adding r4, we get better paths to 10.10.45.0/24 and 10.10.35.0/24 via r4, however the other paths are not affected because adding r4 does not reduce the shortest path length.

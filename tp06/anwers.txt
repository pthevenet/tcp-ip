The subnet 192.10.10.0/24, 192.12.12.0/24 and 192.20.20.0/24 are not onlink on R5, therefore R5 learnt about them by using BGP.
In particular, R1 advertised networks 192.10.10.0/24 and 192.12.12.0/24 to R3 by ebgp, and r2 the networks 192.12.12.0/24 and 192.20.20.0/24 to R4 by ebgp.
Then both routers r3 and r4 updated there ADJ-RIB-IN, and then sends the "best" routes to R5 using ibgp (and to each other).   
This way, R3 and R4 sends route info for the subnets.

[Q2]
KEEPALIVE messages are used to inform bgp neighbors that this peer is still alive.
If a peer A does not receive a KEEPALIVE message from its neighbor B for more than HOLDDOWN seconds, A will declare B dead, and delete all routes from B's announcements.
We find the period of KEEPALIVE messages to be 60 seconds, afer looking on wireshark at two successive KEEPALIVE message from the same peer.

[Q3]
After some time, all hosts and routers can ping each other.
Therefore all subnets are accessible from each router and hosts.

[Q4]
R1 entry for 192.20.20.0/24 :
*> 192.20.20.0      192.13.13.3                            0 65345 65200 ?

R2 entry for 192.10.10.0/24 :
*> 192.10.10.0      192.24.24.4                            0 65345 65100 ?

As we can see :
in R1, to route to 192.20.20.0, the AS paths is 65345 65200, that is it does not directly go to AS 65200 via R2
in R2, to route to 192.10.10.0, the AS paths is 65345 65100, that is it does not directly go to AS 65100 via R1
as expected

[Q5]
First, it requires another process to run on all routers, requiring more expensive routers.
Second, each speaker router in an AS have to maintain a TCP connection to all other speakers. 
This is also expensive and less and less possible when the number of routers incease inside the AS.
Anyhow, BGP is made for inter-AS routing, so it does not "feel" senseful to use it on each router.

[Q6]
On both r4 and r3, we have to update the files bgpd.conf, ospfd.conf and ospf6d.conf :
bgpd.conf : change "redistribute connected" to "redistribute ospf"
ospfd.conf :  add "redistribute bgp"
ospf6d.conf : add "redistribute bgp"
The first change allows the redistribution of routes from ospf into bgp, while the two lasts allows the redistribution of routes learned from bgp to ospf.

[Q7]
The line for subnet 192.20.20.0/24 in R1 :
*> 192.20.20.0      192.13.13.3                            0 65345 65200 ?
The line for subnet 192.10.10.0/24 in R@ :
*> 192.10.10.0      192.24.24.4                            0 65345 65100 ?

We can see that the entries are the same as in Q4.
Therefore it is acceptable, considering that bgp between r1 and r2 is disabled, the routes have to go through AS 65345.

[Q8]
Of course redistributing OSPF into BGP injects routes learned from OSPF into BGP' s table.
Following the hint,
We see that R4 gets the route :
*> 192.20.20.0      192.24.24.2              1             0 65200 ?
from e-bgp.
Then this route is sent to OSPF :
B>* 192.20.20.0/24 [20/1] via 192.24.24.2, r4-eth1, 00:37:29
In R3, OSPF sees this route :
O>* 192.20.20.0/24 [110/20] via 192.34.34.4, r3-eth2, 00:36:43
That looks like a correct OSPF route, except it is a route learned by bgp
And when redistributing OSPF into BGP we see the route :
*> 192.20.20.0      192.34.34.4             20         32768 ?
Which is the chosen route.

This means that the redistribution of the routes learned from OSPF into BGP does not depend on the fact that this route was learned by BGP or not.
This is an incorrect thing to do because BGP understands that 192.20.20.0/24 is local to this area.

Therefore, when redistributing OSPF into BGP, quagga's implementation does not discriminate routes learned from BGP.

[Q9]
Cisco routers, when injecting routes from OSPF into BGP, will drop routes learned by BGP, because it will create the problem described above.
This is not the case for quagga.

[Q10]
The routing entries for 192.10.10.0/24 in r4 :
B   192.10.10.0/24 [200/1] via 192.13.13.1, 00:01:16
O>* 192.10.10.0/24 [110/20] via 192.34.34.3, r4-eth2, 00:01:25

There are 2. The chosen best route is the one with next hop 192.34.34.3 (second one), learned from ospf.
As we can see, the first route has a higher metric [200/1] corresponding to the second one [110/20].
OSPF routes are prefered over ibgp routes, by the administrative distance 200 (ibgp) vs 110 (ospf).
This is to prefer ospf routes over ibgp routes that may need recursive lookup as it is in our case.

[Q11]
We cannot ping between all hosts, h5 and r5 are not reachable outside of their AS.
Since we do not redistribute ospf into bgp, bgp does not know about subnet 192.50.50.0/24 at r3 and r4, that means that this subnet is not advertised to the other ASes.

[Q12]
In r3/bgpd.conf : added "redistribute static"
In r3/zebra.conf : added lines :
	ip route 192.50.50.0/24 r3-eth2
	ipv6 route 2001:1:0:5050::/64 r3-eth2

[Q13]
Now subnet 192.50.50.0/24 is reachable as we can see with these routes :
r1 :
*  192.50.50.0      192.12.12.2                            0 65200 65345 ?
*>              		    192.13.13.3              0             0 65345 ?
r2 :
*> 192.50.50.0      192.24.24.4                            0 65345 ?
*                	       	      192.12.12.1                            0 65100 65345 ?

[Q14]
At R3, entries to subnet 192.50.50.0/24 :
O   192.50.50.0/24 [110/20] via 192.34.34.5, r3-eth2, 00:10:32
S>* 192.50.50.0/24 [1/0] is directly connected, r3-eth2
There are two routes.
The chosen route is the second one, the static route (S) because we can see its administrative distance is 1 compared to 110 for the first route by ospf.

[Q15]
Looking at the routing tables we can see that from each router each subnet is accessible.
Testing with pingall validates the claim.

In R1, the entries for 192.50.50.0/24 are :
*  192.50.50.0      192.12.12.2                            0 65200 65345 i
*>               		    192.13.13.3              0             0 65345 i
As we can see, the second entry is chosen because the AS path is shorter (one less AS to go through).

[Q16]
We can see this messages : 
2017/12/20 13:33:03 BGP: 192.34.34.3 rcvd UPDATE about 192.10.10.0/24 -- withdrawn
2017/12/20 13:33:03 BGP: 192.34.34.3 rcvd UPDATE about 192.12.12.0/24 -- withdrawn
2017/12/20 13:33:03 BGP: 192.34.34.3 rcvd UPDATE about 192.13.13.0/24 -- withdrawn
2017/12/20 13:33:03 BGP: 192.34.34.3 rcvd UPDATE about 192.20.20.0/24 -- withdrawn
This means that BGP on r3 announces that subnets 192.10.10.0/24, 192.12.12.0/24, 192.13.13.0/24 are not reachable for r3 anymore.

[Q17]
At r3 we see the routes :
B   192.10.10.0/24 [200/0] via 192.24.24.2, 00:00:19
O>* 192.10.10.0/24 [110/20] via 192.34.34.4, r3-eth2, 00:00:20

on bgp routes :
*>i192.10.10.0      192.24.24.2                   100      0 65200 65100 ?
The bgp route goes to r2 by AS 65200 then to AS 65100 because it cannot go directly to AS 65100 now.

Which means that r3 routes packets with destination 192.10.10.0/24 to r4.

[Q18]
The routes to 192.50.50/24 :

   Network          Next Hop            Metric LocPrf Weight Path
*  192.50.50.0      192.12.12.2                            0 65200 65345 i
*>                  192.13.13.3              0             0 65345 i

There are two routes to this network.
The chosen one is to next hop r3 (second one), because of the shortest AS-PATH (local pref is 0 anyway).

From R1 we cannot ping to this subnet because r3 is not connected to the subnet in the AS.
This is because R3 advertises the subnet192.50.50/24 because of the configuration (network ...).

[Q19]
In BGP table, it only lacks an entry for 192.34.34.0/24.
Because it does redistribute from ospf but r3-eth2 is shut down, and we do not force it as for 192.50.50.0/24 with "network ...".
Moreover redistribution of OSPF into BGP is disabled, and since 192.34.34.0/24 because r1 does not send ebgp routes to r3 for this subnet because it would create a loop.
It has an entry for 192.50.50.0 because we force it by network ... cmd

[Q20]

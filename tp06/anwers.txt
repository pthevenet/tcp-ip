The subnet 192.10.10.0/24, 192.12.12.0/24 and 192.20.20.0/24 are not onlink on R5, therefore R5 learnt about them by using BGP.
In particular, R1 advertised networks 192.10.10.0/24 and 192.12.12.0/24 to R3 by ebgp, and r2 the networks 192.12.12.0/24 and 192.20.20.0/24 to R4 by ebgp.
Then both routers r3 and r4 updated there ADJ-RIB-IN, and then sends the "best" routes to R5 using ibgp (and to each other).   
This way, R3 and R4 sends route info for the subnets.

[Q2]
KEEPALIVE messages are used to inform bgp neighbors that this peer is still alive.
If a peer A does not receive a KEEPALIVE message from its neighbor B for more than HOLDDOWN seconds, A will declare B dead, and delete all routes from B's announcements.
We find the period of KEEPALIVE messages to be 60 seconds, afer looking on wireshark at two successive KEEPALIVE message from the same peer.

[Q3]
After some time, all hosts and routers can ping each other.
Therefore all subnets are accessible from each router and hosts.

R1 entry for 192.20.20.0/24 :
*> 192.20.20.0      192.13.13.3                            0 65345 65200 ?

R2 entry for 192.10.10.0/24 :
*> 192.10.10.0      192.24.24.4                            0 65345 65100 ?

As we can see :
in R1, to route to 192.20.20.0, the AS paths is 65345 65200, that is it does not directly go to AS 65200 via R2
in R2, to route to 192.10.10.0, the AS paths is 65345 65100, that is it does not directly go to AS 65100 via R1
as expected

[Q3]
Both codes uses TCP sockects and IPv4 (AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM are passed to the socket function)

[Q4]
This is used to see if a process is using port 5002, and its state.
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5002          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
Therefore a process is using a TCP socket at port 5002 and is currently listening. Indeed this is our code C running.

[Q5]
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5002          0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:43742         127.0.0.1:5002          ESTABLISHED
tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:5002          127.0.0.1:43742         ESTABLISHED


Yes it is different : we can see two new lines, one for the server socket, one for the client socket. These corresponds to the new established connection.
Line 1 is the listening socket of the server.
Line 2 is the socket of the client D, connected to the socket of the server C.
Line 3 is the socket of the server C, connected to the socket of the client D.

[Q6]
The server displayed three lines.
We see in the code of C that we can specify how many bytes to get from the socket buffer each time we read. This is due to TCP being stream oriented.
For this we use the function socket.recv(x) where x is the number of bytes we want to read.

[Q7]
It does not execute. Because the code blocks on connection.recv, waiting for data from server, or a connection loss.

[Q8]
No, the listening socket is only used to establish connections, and netstat tells us this is not the same socket as established connections.
The listening socket is not bound to any remote/ip port, and therefore no receive and send are explicitly performed on the listening socket.

[Q9]
Yes it does execute, this is because this time the data received is Null (in C's code), because the connection has been stopped, as it is specified by TCP's protocol (FIN ACK FIN ACK).

[Q10]
We received 8 messages (data 0 to 7), with d=0 or d=1.

[Q11]
From the PDU :
With d=0 we get 2 TCP segments with payload length > 0 (length 18 bytes and the second 126).
With d=1 we get 8 TCP segments with payload length > 0 (all of length 18 bytes)

[Q12]
With d=0, the server can send all responses at the same time, therefore TCP can concatenate the data sent into 1 or more packets (2 in our case).
On the other hand, with d=1, the PDU sends a response every 1s, and the TCP in the server is (probably) configured not to wait to concatenate packets if the data is slow to be sent to the socket, therefore we see 1 packet for each response, wich looks like a message oriented connection, but is not.

[Q13]
The client can wait for the FIN segment from the server to understand that it received all messages (since TCP ensures that no packet is dropped).
If the server fails, there is no way to be sure (no FIN segment).

[Q14]
We get 5 TCP segments with payload length > 0

[Q16]
1. With recv(5000) we get 6 recv calls needed. With recv(18), 913 calls.
2. Clearly no, the recv function reads in the socket buffer, which available data length has little correspondence with the actual received segments (e.g. the length of the segments are not predictable, but we explicitly ask for a number of bytes in recv call).
3. According to 1. the bufsize argument of the recv() method affects the number of calls, otherwise the delay between successive received segments (counting reordering) can affect the number of calls, because recv(bufsize) reads at most bufsize, but can read less if the data takes long to come.

Yes : socket.IPPROTO_IP, socket.IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP
IP_ADD_MEMBERSHIP to join a multicast group, with the value containing the group 224.1.1.1 and INADDR_ANY to bind to any interfaces.

[Q21]
Yes, we need to set the IP_MULTICAST_TTL to more than one (we set it to 127) so that our message can be forwarded past the first multicast router (default IP_MULTICAST_TTL is 1).
ttl = struct.pack('b', 127)

[Q23]
We received 4 TCP packets, each containing one or more Websocket packets. In total we received 8 PMUs, and 8 Websocket packets.
Yes the number is different.

[Q24]
We don't have an on_message event in our code. (Why would we ? Our code works.)
But recv is called 8 times.
We can conclude that using websocket is a way to use message oriented protocol while using TCP, therefore it is easier to use websocket than 'raw' tcp when dealing with messages and not flows of data.

[Q25]
Using wireshark, we see one websocket packet, and 4 TCP (underlying) packets, coming from the server carrying text.
Again : We don't have an on_message event in our code. (Why would we ? Our code works.)
We get using websocket only one call to recv.
Here we only get one websocket packet, while we got many tcp packets in 2.
As we said in Q24, this is because websocket provides a message based protocol, and not a flow based protocol as in TCP.
